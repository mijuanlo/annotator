Description: C# like language for the GObject system
 Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring modern programming
 language features to GNOME developers without imposing any additional
 runtime requirements and without using a different ABI compared to
 applications and libraries written in C.
 .
 valac, the Vala compiler, is a self-hosting compiler that translates
 Vala source code into C source and header files.  It uses the GObject
 type system to create classes and interfaces declared in the Vala
 source code. This package also contains the vala-gen-introspect and
 vapigen binaries that will automatically generate Vala bindings.
